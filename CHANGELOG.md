# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **CI frontend lint conformance** — Resolved biome `noAssignInExpressions` in the emoji/math CodeMirror fold-extension regex loops (refactored the `while ((m = re.exec(text)))` scan to a `for` loop so `continue` stays safe) and auto-applied the remaining `useTemplate`, `useOptionalChain`, import-sorting, and formatter fixes across the web app. The CI `frontend` job (lint/typecheck/test/build) is green again.

### Changed
- **Version bump to 1.17.0** — All workspace crates updated to 1.17.0 (package + internal dependency versions); Cargo.lock re-synced.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Skill management UI** — Create, edit, and import skills with Claude-grade UX (`.skill` file import, inline editor).
- **Unified model picker** — Role + model selection merged into a single `ModelPicker` component.
- **Role editor** — Inline role config editor in the settings engine panel.
- **Cron schedule editor** — Visual cron expression builder and schedule management UI.
- **Token-maxing billing model** — Final wiring of `billing_model` sourced from live provider snapshot.

### Changed
- **Chat input shell refactor** — Complete UX overhaul of the chat input area and model picker layout.
- **Unified streaming orchestration (RFC-033)** — Ouroboros streaming architecture refactor for consistent event flow.
- **Batch workspace changes** — Pending workspace dependency updates.

### Fixed
- **Chat + sidebar hardening (RFC-032)** — Audit-driven fixes for chat state and sidebar reliability.
- **Agent completion status** — Successful agents now correctly marked `Completed` instead of `Idle`.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.16.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Calendar integration** — Event creation, editing, deletion, conflict detection, iCalendar import/export, journal bridge, and cron bridge for scheduling.
- **Command palette** — ⌘K command palette for quick navigation and actions.
- **Skill forge tool** — Agent-facing tool for skill generation, validation, packaging, and benchmarking.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Live activity transparency** — Real-time agent progress display through SSE streaming_sink and live-activity bar, showing thinking/reasoning/phase transitions to the user.
- **MCP server edit dialog** — Inline dialog for editing MCP server config (command, args, env, enable/disable).
- **Mount edit dialog** — Inline dialog for editing mount names.
- **Persona edit dialog** — Inline dialog for editing persona config.
- **Cron job management UI** — List view and edit dialog for cron jobs.
- **Kernel streaming sink** — `StreamingSinkRegistry` for agent-to-client real-time transparency.
- **i18n updates** — EN/KO translations for all new UI components.

### Changed
- **Gateway rework** — Improved message routing and event bus architecture.
- **Typing indicator** — Real-time update improvements for WebSocket-based chat.
- **State store & session nav** — Enhanced session navigation and state persistence.
- **Workspace members** — Added `oxios-ouroboros` and `oxios-gateway` to workspace members for full CI coverage across all published crates.

### Fixed
- **Clippy warnings** — 7 lint fixes across kernel, MCP, and API routes (collapsible if, clone on copy, len_without_is_empty, unnecessary get-then-check).

## [1.13.2] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- **Structural/tool-output localization** — All tool and structural output (CLI `--help`, error messages, permission-denial reasons, Telegram & gateway messages, config output) is now English, aligning with the AGENTS.md convention that structural output is English for a global product. Agent conversational replies still follow the user's language.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **Calendar enabled by default** — `CalendarConfig.enabled` now defaults to `true` (serde field default + `Default` impl); fresh installs no longer see calendar 503s in the web UI.
- **Disabled-subsystem 503 handling (web)** — react-query no longer retries a permanent "subsystem not available" 503; the notification-center schedule widget shows a friendly "enable in settings" prompt when a subsystem (calendar/email) is disabled.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **RFC-031: token-maxing mode** — Unattended work within configured windows, gated to subscription-only providers (never API-credit plans). Adds `token_maxing/` (QuotaTracker, BudgetGuard, WorkPlanner, TokenMaxingSession), a `TokenMaxingApi` with REST routes under `/api/token-maxing/*`, assembler wiring, a config block, and a web provider-status panel + session report.
- **Cost aggregation** — Per-provider token/cost tracking through the kernel, with ZAI + Minimax subscription quota fetchers powering token-maxing's eligibility detection.
- **Cost & quota REST endpoints** — Spend/cost/quota surface for the new cost dashboard.
- **Unified agent monitor + cost views** — Redesigned web IA: A2A, agent-groups, approvals, events collapsed into a single Agents view; new cost dashboard with spend limits.
- **Budget config block** — `share/default-config.toml` ships a `[budget]` section.
- **Persona security review** — Hardened persona creation/edit paths.

### Changed
- Web: biome formatting + lint conformance (import ordering, `Number.isNaN`, React Flow a11y) across cost/agent-monitor/budget/engine views.
- Workspace `cargo fmt` applied across the release range.

### Fixed
- **Chat WebSocket join-set** — Leaked join handles on the chat stream are now correctly awaited.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- **RFC-030: runtime task supervision** — A single-process task supervisor now owns a root `CancellationToken` for cooperative shutdown, replacing the standalone `scheduler` module. Gateway/web surfaces wire their graceful-shutdown path to the supervisor token instead of listening to `ctrl_c` independently, giving a single shutdown signal source. Adds a `tokio-util` `CancellationToken`, drops the `[scheduler]` config section, and threads shutdown through the infra/system routes and metrics.
- **Web notification center** — Slide-over notification panel backed by a dedicated store, surfaced from the header bell.
- **Calendar UI refresh** — A mini-calendar popover trigger in the header replaces the standalone `/calendar` and `/scheduler` routes; sidebar nav and i18n (en/ko) updated.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- **Removed explicit chat/ouroboros mode toggle** — The web UI no longer exposes a manual chat/spec (Ouroboros) mode toggle. Intent detection is now automatic: the orchestrator interviews when intent is unclear, instead of requiring the user to switch modes. Removes the specMode store state, toggle button, ⌘⇧M shortcut, placeholder variants, the stream-chunk mode field, and the backend MODE meta constant.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-06-25

### Security
- **RUSTSEC-2026-0185 (quinn-proto)** — Bumped `quinn-proto` 0.11.14 → 0.11.15 via a lockfile-only `cargo update`, fixing a remote memory-exhaustion vector from unbounded out-of-order stream reassembly. The vulnerability was reachable transitively via `reqwest → quinn → quinn-proto`. No API or behavior change; `cargo audit` now reports zero vulnerabilities.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- **RFC-029: execution resilience** — OTP-style recovery layered on the existing Unix supervisor: snapshot/restore, `SupervisorPolicy` + `RestartBackoff`, and `ModelSwitched` lifecycle events (adopted from oxi-sdk). A bounded recovery ladder runs on provider failure: L0 execute → L1 restart (same model) → L2 snapshot+restore-with-new-model → L3 compact-or-larger → L4 A2A delegate → L5 terminal `ResilientFailure`. Backed by error classification (`FailureClass`), a shared `AttemptBudget`, and a per-provider circuit breaker (`ProviderHealthRegistry`) that replaces the global `LLM_CIRCUIT_BREAKER`.

### Fixed
- **P0: provider errors now propagate as `Err`** — `run_agent` previously swallowed provider failures as `Ok(success:false)`, burying them in `ExecutionResult.output`. It now returns `Err`, so the lifecycle boundary and the recovery ladder can react. `ExecutionResult` carries `failure_class` + `restore_state` so the class/state survive even when a caller returns `Ok(success:false)`.

### Changed
- `oxios-ouroboros` gains a resilience bridge for directive-level recovery; the orchestrator wires `RecoveryCoordinator` behind a read lock and falls back to the direct lifecycle when unconfigured.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **RFC-027: single-path intent pipeline** — Ouroboros type reorg consolidating the intent (assess → crystallize → execute → review) flow into a single path; orchestrator/agent-runtime/gateway migrated to root-level ouroboros types.
- **RFC-024: web↔daemon reliability** — full SP1–SP4 close: message ordering + replay buffer, atomic web-dist swap (no 404 window), subsystem readiness gate (503 until warm, Degraded counts as ready), and client-side WS keepalive/resume.

### Fixed
- **Chat WebSocket connects when auth is disabled** — v1.8.1's F3 token hardening blocked the WS in the default no-auth config (no login UI exists to set a token), leaving chat stuck on "재연결 중". The frontend now reads `auth_enabled` from `/api/status` (newly exposed) and connects without credentials when auth is off.
- **Auth-enabled browser WebSocket** — `/api/chat/stream` no longer fails the upgrade under `require_auth` (browsers cannot attach a Bearer header to a WebSocket); authentication is enforced by the handler via the `?ticket=` query param.
- **Memory HTTP API wired to the MemoryManager** — list/get/stats/pin/delete previously read the legacy category state-store while `create` wrote to the SQLite MemoryManager, so the memory page was always empty and mutations 404'd. All five handlers now use the MemoryManager (via four new `AgentApi` methods), and four missing routes are registered (`dream/status`, `dream/reports`, `{id}/pin`, `DELETE {name}`). Response shapes match the frontend `MemoryDetail`/`MemoryStats` types.
- **Memory overview renders in production builds** — recharts 3.x `BarChart`/`PieChart` threw `TypeError: t is not a function` when bundled by rolldown (vite v8); replaced with a dependency-free CSS bar.
- **Web lint** — auto-fixed pre-existing biome violations (`useLiteralKeys`, `organizeImports`) that failed the v1.8.1 release CI.

### Changed
- Kernel/orchestrator/gateway refactored to root-level ouroboros types; legacy five-phase integration tests dropped.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- **Cargo.lock update** — Lockfile refresh to include the correct dependency resolution for the v1.7.0 release.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- **oxi-sdk 0.37.1 → 0.45.1.** Workspace dependency bumped. `oxi-agent`'s `AgentConfig` gained four `#[serde(skip, default)]` fields (`ttsr_engine`, `memory`, `todo`, `agent_pool`); the single construction site in `crates/oxios-kernel/src/agent_runtime.rs::run_agent` now ends with `..Default::default()`. Catalog-port (0.37.0), `ask` tool rename (0.40.0), edition-2024 lift (0.41.x), and `resolve_model_from_id` catalog fallback (0.45.0) are all additive; no source-level behavior change for oxios.
- **ProjectManager schema initialization** — `ProjectManager::new` now calls `ensure_project_schema` to bootstrap the project database tables, mirroring `MountManager`'s startup behavior.


## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added — RFC-028: Web UI Delivery
- **AgentStopped `success` flag (SP-1a)** — `KernelEvent::AgentStopped` now carries `success: bool`. `sanitize_event` serializes it as `agent_stopped.success` on the SSE wire. The supervisor emits `result.success` on the Ok path and `false` on kill/terminate. `#[serde(default)]` keeps older consumers working.
- **Completion notifications (SP-1b)** — `use-global-events.ts` handles `agent_stopped` events: `success:true` → "Task Completed" (success severity), `success:false` → "Task Failed" (warning). Cross-event dedup suppresses `agent_stopped(success:false)` when `agent_failed` was already emitted within 30s.
- **Notification persistence (SP-1c)** — Zustand `persist` middleware stores unread notifications (max 30) in `localStorage` under `oxios-notifications`. Read notifications are transient.
- **Desktop notifications + sound (SP-1d)** — New `desktop-notify.ts` (Notification API, background-tab only) and `sound.ts` (Web Audio oscillator, severity-distinct tones). Integrated into `use-global-events`.
- **Notification preferences (SP-1e)** — Client-side toggles for desktop notifications, sound, completion sound, and error sound in a new Settings → Notifications section. Stored in `localStorage`.
- **Declarative config sections (SP-2a)** — Six config sections now editable in Settings: `calendar`, `otel`, `agent_log`, `resource_monitor`, `browser`, `budget`. All use the existing declarative field-defs framework; no backend changes needed.
- **Secrets API (SP-2b)** — `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/secrets[/{key}]` and `GET /api/secrets/{key}/source`. Stores credentials in `~/.oxi/auth.json` via `CredentialStore`, never in `config.toml` plaintext. Responses are masked (`has_value`, `source`, `preview`).
- **Secrets UI (SP-2c)** — Settings → Secrets section with per-key password inputs, source badges, and masked previews.
- **Trace trajectory join (SP-3a)** — `GET /api/agents/{id}/trace` now merges session trajectory steps with `agent.tool_calls` (deduped by `tool_call_id`). Trace steps carry a `kind` field (`tool` | `memory` | `reasoning`) for future expansion.
- **UI polish (SP-4)** — Shadow tokens added (`--shadow-sm/md/lg`) with dark-mode alpha 0.2–0.4 vs light 0.04–0.08. Background raised to `oklch(0.99 0 0)` for card elevation. `focus-visible` added to header/sidebar buttons. Global `<kbd>` styling.

### Changed
- `CredentialStore` gains `delete()` and `resolve_secret()` methods for non-provider key management.
- `settings.tsx` `buildPayload` now parses `multiline` fields as JSON (for `browser.engine`); form population JSON.stringifies multiline object values.
- `SectionIconKey` union extended with 8 new icon keys; `section-icons.tsx` `ICON_MAP` updated.
- Settings consistency test updated to include `secrets` and `notifications` custom sections.
## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- **Web daemon startup reliability** — Hardened `oxios start` / `oxios serve` against silent failure modes (RFC-024 territory):
  - Pre-spawn port guard detects an orphaned oxios process still holding the port past a stale/missing pidfile, so the spawned daemon's bind no longer fails silently while the readiness probe reports success against the old listener.
  - A readiness-probe miss now surfaces the daemon log tail and fails the start instead of printing a misleading "started".
  - `oxios serve` refuses to start a daemon whose web assets could not be obtained (it would have served 503 on every web request); CLI/Telegram-only configs with the web surface disabled are unaffected.
  - `web_dist` auto-download from GitHub Releases now retries with a bounded backoff so a transient network blip or rate-limit does not strand the daemon.
  - Unit tests added for `port_in_use` and the startup guards.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Interview wizard a11y / keyboard** — Roving focus for option groups (ArrowLeft/Right on `single_choice` auto-selects like a native radiogroup), Space to focus-and-select, Shift+Enter inserts a newline in `free_text`, and `role="group"` / `aria-pressed` / `aria-label` on option buttons so screen readers announce selection state and group semantics. The `keyboardHint` strings (en/ko) are updated to reflect the new bindings. A new test file covers the keyboard + selection behavior across `single_choice`, `multi_choice`, and `free_text` kinds.

### Changed
- **Refactor: live model resolution via `ModelResolver` port** — All LLM-bound phases now read the live, post-hot-swap engine default through a new `ModelResolver` trait (`oxios-ouroboros::ModelResolver`) instead of capturing a frozen model id at construction. This eliminates the divergence where interview / seed / evaluate / evolve used a boot-time model while execute re-resolved via the engine handle, and surfaces a bad model id at the first phase call instead of silently at execute.
  - `OuroborosEngine::new` now takes `Arc<dyn ModelResolver>` and resolves the live default + provider at the start of every LLM-bound phase. Tests use a new `StaticModelResolver` helper.
  - `EngineHandle` (kernel) implements `ModelResolver`; `OxiosEngine` gains a provider cache that survives across reads within one generation and is cleared on `swap`.
  - `EngineApi::set_model` validates the new model BEFORE persisting (rejects unknown models / unconfigured providers), so a Web UI "switch succeeded" is truthful and a bad model id no longer surfaces only at execute time.
  - `AgentRuntime`, `PersistenceHook`, `KnowledgeDream`, `KnowledgeLens` drop their frozen `model_id` fields and resolve live on each call.
  - Boot-time validation: a broken configured model now fails the daemon fast instead of silently at every curation run (`KnowledgeDream`, `KernelBuilder`).

### Fixed
- **Clippy: clear pre-existing lints on v1.5.2** — A clippy upgrade since v1.5.2 surfaced 38 mechanical lints (in `option_map_unit_fn`, `field_reassign_with_default`, `items_after_test_module`, `needless_borrows_for_generic_args`, `nonminimal_bool`, `ptr_arg`, `useless_conversion`, `cloned_ref_to_slice_refs`, `unused_imports`, and `dead_code`). All are addressed without behavior change. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` (the documented quality gate) now passes locally and matches CI.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Security: wasmtime-wasi RUSTSEC-2026-0182** — Upgraded the `wasmtime` / `wasmtime-wasi` dependency from 22 to 24.0.10 (the backport release that fixes the WASIp1 `fd_renumber` resource leak). `cargo audit` now reports zero vulnerabilities. `wasm-sandbox` is still an optional, non-default feature, so default builds were unaffected, but the published `oxios-kernel` now resolves to the patched transitive dependency.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **`oxios update` overhaul** — Progress bars for all three update stages (web UI download with byte/speed/ETA, zip extraction file count, `cargo install` spinner that reflects the live compile line) and automatic daemon restart after a successful update so the new binary/web UI takes effect immediately. A `--no-restart` flag opts out, and restart only fires when the daemon is already running.

### Fixed
- **Web i18n (Korean UI)** — Restored 189 translation keys that were missing from both `en.json` and `ko.json` (mounts, projects, email, knowledge UI, chat/questionnaire, agents/sessions, dataTable, shared common/settings), which had been rendering as raw `section.key` strings in the UI.
- **`oxios update`** — A daemon restart failure no longer masks a successful update; it now warns and points at `oxios start` for manual recovery instead of exiting as a failure.
- **Web i18n polish** — `questionnaire.count` singular/plural ("1 questions"), mounts rescan terminology consistency, and removal of a dead duplicate `chat.questionnaire.*` namespace.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **RFC-024 web↔daemon reliability** — Atomic static-asset distribution with content-hash references, hard timeouts on all SSE/WS streams, and a readiness gate (SP4) so the web surface only serves after the kernel is fully initialized. Gateway gains a SP1/SP2 reliability layer.
- **RFC-025 Mount + Project system** — Unified notion of host directories mounted into the workspace as first-class Project bundles:
  - Mount core + Workspace Context injection (Phase 1) and Project bundle layer + agent enrichment (Phase 2/3).
  - Frontend Mount UI with detection badge and Project bundle rendering.
  - Phase 4 Mount rescan; Phase 5 frequent-path auto-promotion to Mounts.
  - Project-tree sidebar with drag-to-reparent and data migration.
- **Mobile responsive design (Web)** — Full responsive redesign (Phases 1–5) across chat, control, browse, and settings surfaces.
- **Settings UX overhaul (Web)** — Range sliders, full tool checklist (replacing the allowed_tools tag-input), CORS editor, and field-control polish.

### Changed
- **Version bump to 1.4.0** — All crates updated to 1.4.0; web `package.json` aligned to 1.4.0.
- **Rust 2024 edition + oxi-sdk 0.35.0** — Workspace migrated to edition 2024 and bumped to oxi-sdk 0.35.0 (native-browser fix).
- **wasm-sandbox wasmtime 22 migration** — Resolved `WasiCtx`, `fuel_remaining`, `define_wasi`, and `Memory::read` API drift; `cargo build/clippy --workspace --all-features` now passes cleanly.
- **Iconography (Web)** — Replaced emoji across the UI with lucide-react icons.

### Fixed
- **RFC-025 review pass** — Fixed all critical, major, and minor issues identified in the review across the stack (remaining substantive bugs, last design issues).
- **Settings** — Phantom memory changes from a non-existent field key; `dream_interval_hours` slider max reduced from 168h to 72h; settings shell flex layout-break on narrow screens.
- **Web** — Accidental text selection on interactive UI chrome.
- **Frontend provider catalog** — Missing provider models added to the fallback catalog.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Agent History Log** — Persistent agent records survive daemon restarts.
  - Dual-tier storage: filesystem JSON (source of truth, `state/agents/<id>.json`) + SQLite query index (`state/agent_log.db`) with FTS5 full-text search.
  - `AgentLogDb` query engine: filtering (status, date range, session/project/seed), sorting (cost, duration, tokens, name), pagination, search across agent name / error / tool names / tool outputs.
  - `KernelHandle::reindex()` rebuilds the SQLite index from filesystem JSON at any time. SQLite is optional via the `sqlite-memory` feature; falls back to filesystem scan when disabled.
- **`AgentStatus::Completed`** — New terminal status for agents that finish successfully; integrated into the agent stats aggregation (`Idle`/`Stopped`/`Completed` → `completed`).
- **RFC-015 knowledge/memory separation** — Distinguished agent memory (`MemoryManager`) from user knowledge notes (`KnowledgeBase`), clarifying the two-system boundary.
- **RFC-016 autonomous persistence** — Agent-generated notes persist with provenance metadata automatically.
- **RFC-022 knowledge provenance, quality metadata & dream curation** — Notes carry `source` (Hook/Agent) and `quality` (Raw/Reviewed) frontmatter; dream consolidation curates based on quality.
- **Interactive interview wizard (Web)** — Multi-round Ouroboros interview UI with Q&A preserved across turns, typing indicator, and structured question rendering.
- **Chat & dashboard redesign (Web)** — Redesigned chat (tool-name transparency, session titles, keyboard shortcuts) and dashboard (agent status, system health, live activity feed, approvals queue).

### Changed
- **Version bump to 1.3.0** — All crates updated to 1.3.0.
- **Interview multi-turn context** — Original user message and prior Q&A are now included in interview context so the LLM understands follow-up rounds.
- **Evaluation semantics** — `evaluation_passed` modelled as `Option<bool>` end-to-end (gateway → web → frontend) for correct null semantics.
- **Async-trait restoration** — Replaced manual `Pin<Box<...>>` boilerplate with the `async-trait` macro in the kernel.

### Fixed
- **Test compile & clippy** — Resolved incomplete `agent_log_db` module (added `AgentStatus::Completed` variant, completed `parse_status` mapping) and cleared all `clippy -D warnings` lints in the new code.
- **Agent stats SQL NULL handling** — `SUM(CASE …)` / `AVG(…)` / `MIN`/`MAX` aggregates now wrapped in `COALESCE` and read as `Option`, so stats queries succeed on empty/all-NULL tables.
- **i18n** — Added missing `common.justNow` / `minutesAgo` / `hoursAgo` translation keys.
- **Frontend provider catalog** — Added missing provider models to the frontend fallback catalog.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **OxiBrowser Observability v0.12 — Phases 3 & 4** — Real-time tool progress flows from the oxi-agent loop through oxios-kernel → oxios-web → frontend.
  - `KernelEvent::ToolExecutionProgress` variant + `agent_runtime` forwarding of `AgentEvent::ToolExecutionUpdate { partial_result }`
  - oxios-web converts the new event into a `tool_progress` WS chunk (and SSE event)
  - Frontend: `StreamChunk.tool_progress` → `ChatActivity.tool_call` with `progress` and `isRunning: true`; `tool_start` sets `isRunning: true`, `tool_end` clears it
  - `ActivityCard` renders a `Loader2` spinner for running tool calls and shows the latest progress text inline
- **OxiBrowser Observability v0.12 — Phase 5 (tab-id propagation)** — Browser tab id propagation through kernel → web → frontend, enabling concurrent tab distinction in the chat transparency timeline.
  - `KernelEvent::ToolExecutionProgress` gains `tab_id: Option<Uuid>` (optional, serde skip-if-none for back-compat).
  - WS/SSE events include `tab_id`; frontend `ActivityCard` shows a short tab-id badge.
  - Audit-action detail string appends `:tab=<id>` when tab is known.
- **RFC-018 b.1: Memory extraction** — `chunking`, `normalizer`, `hyperbolic` modules extracted from `oxios-kernel::memory` to new `oxios-memory` leaf crate.
  - Back-compat: `use oxios_kernel::chunk_fixed` etc. all continue to work.
- **oxios-calendar** — New `.ics`-based calendar event management crate (parse, query, CRUD).
- **Email subsystem** — SMTP-based email sending integration (`leitner`), template management, sent history, provider config.
- **Calendar CLI** — `oxios calendar` subcommand with `list`, `add`, `delete`, `search`, `import`, `export`.
- **Email CLI** — `oxios email` subcommand with `setup`, `test`, `history`, `templates`.
- **Email & Calendar REST API** — Full CRUD endpoints on `/api/email/*` and `/api/calendar/*`.

### Changed
- **Version bump to 1.1.0** — All crates updated to 1.1.0 for first crates.io publication.
- **Memory re-export layer** — `oxios-kernel` re-exports the moved memory types so downstream crates (web, gateway) require no source changes.
- **Release profile applied** — `[profile.release]` with `lto = "thin"`, `codegen-units = 1`, `strip = true`, `panic = "abort"`, `opt-level = 3`. Binary size ~50 MB.
- **CI workflow hardened** — Workflow-level `permissions: contents: read`; `cargo-audit` uses `taiki-e/install-action`; target cache key includes `${{ github.sha }}`.
- **Release workflow permissions** — Read-only default; release job keeps `contents: write`.

### Fixed
- **TSC errors** — All 96 pre-existing + 3 v0.12-scope TypeScript errors cleared to 0.
- **Clippy warnings** — 14 warnings in binary crate (`src/main.rs`, `src/kernel.rs`, `src/web_dist.rs`) resolved.
- **CI formatting drift** — `cargo fmt` inconsistencies across kernel, web, and binary crate rectified.
- **CI clippy feature flag** — Fixed `browser` feature not existing on core crates in CI workflow.
- **Dead-code warning** — `WebDistResult::Embedded` marked `#[allow(dead_code)]`.

### Removed
- **Legacy `share/default-programs/`** — Superseded by `share/default-skills/` per RFC-009.

### Release Infrastructure
- **Publish order** — `release.yml` updated: `oxios-memory` and `oxios-calendar` added to publish sequence in correct dependency order.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- **Version bump to 1.0.2** — All crates updated: oxios, oxios-kernel, oxios-markdown, oxios-ouroboros, oxios-gateway, oxios-mcp, oxios-web, oxios-cli, oxios-telegram
- **Path dependencies updated** — All internal workspace dependencies now reference 1.0.2

### Notes
